`JAX-Fluids <https://github.com/tumaer/JAXFLUIDS>`_ is a fully-differentiable CFD solver for 3D, compressible two-phase flows. 
We developed this package with the intention to push and facilitate research at the intersection of ML and CFD. 
It is easy to use - running a simulation only requires a couple lines of code. 
Written entirely in JAX, the solver runs on CPU/GPU/TPU and enables automatic differentiation for end-to-end optimization of numerical models.

To learn more about implementation details and details on numerical methods provided 
by JAX-Fluids, feel free to read `our paper <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465522002466>`_.

This documentation is work in progress.

Quick Installation
------------------
This is a quick installation guide to get you set up with JAX-Fluids. Please check out our detailed :doc:`installation guide <installation>` for more information!
Install ``jaxfluids`` to your Python environment.

.. code:: console

      $ git clone https://github.com/tumaer/JAXFLUIDS.git jaxfluids
      $ cd jaxfluids 
      $ pip install .

Let's run a quick simulation to check if everything is up and working.
