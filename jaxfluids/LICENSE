* JAX-FLUIDS is a comprehensive fully-differentiable compressible two-phase    *
* CFD Python package. JAX-FLUIDS allows the simulation of complex fluid        *
* dynamics with phenomena like three-dimensional turbulence, compressibility   *
* effects, and two-phase flows. Written entirely in JAX, it is straightforward *
* to include existing ML models into the proposed framework. Furthermore,      *
* JAX-FLUIDS enables end-to-end optimization. I.e., ML models are optimized    *
* with gradients that are backpropagted through the entire CFD algorithm,      *
* and therefore contain not only information of the underlying PDE but also of * 
* the applied numerical methods. We believe that a Python package like         *
* JAX-FLUIDS is crucial to facilitate the intersection of ML and CFD, and may  *
* pave the way for an era of  research at differentiable fluid dynamics.       *
